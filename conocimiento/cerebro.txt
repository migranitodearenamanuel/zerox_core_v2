Bitcoin appreciated tremendously during the last few months of 2015, but the trend is beginning to shift. The 4-hour chart is clearly showing that the market started to print lower-highs, and also lower-lows, towards the end of December. The trading channel is now starting to curve lower and this kind of price action is very suggestive of an impending bear market.
For speculators, the $433 price level has become a major battle zone. This pivot has acted as support/resistance several times during the second half of December. If price breaks above $433 and trades near the $440 level for some time; $433 will most likely turn into support again.
A failure to break above $433 will most likely result in another plunge towards the big pivot area between $405-$406. This price level was respected on multiple occasions last month, so it is of great technical significance. And sell-off will most likely stall near this range.

News of bans, restrictions, or endorsements from governments can cause sharp price fluctuations.
Global events, such as inflation fears or economic instability, can drive investors to Bitcoin as a hedge.
Technical analysis forms the backbone of Bitcoin Price Analysis. Here are some commonly used tools:
Tracks the average price over a specific period, smoothing out short-term fluctuations.
Indicates whether Bitcoin is overbought or oversold, helping traders time their entry and exit points.
Tracks volatility, showing periods of high or low price movements.
While no analysis can guarantee exact price predictions, trends in Bitcoin Analysis offer insights:

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index (RSI) compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, especially when used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

+

Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels like 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence has its roots enshrined in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, Liber Abaci, popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields like science, nature, architecture, and finance, especially because of its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms have Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, for oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and co... [TRUNCADO]

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Home » Crypto & Blockchain » Crypto Alert – Alt Season 2025 Is Here
Crypto alt season 2025 officially started on November 9th, 2024.
Three indicators confirm crypto alt season 2025 started on November 9th: crypto total market cap excl. BTC and ETH breaks out, Dogecoin clears its 50% Fibonacci level, the USD remains below 107 points.
In this article, we review 3 out of the 4 indicators that are screaming ALT SEASON 2025 is here.
Interestingly, the 4th indicator is testing a breakout, so it might be a matter of hours or days until all alt season 2025 confirmations are in!
First alt season indicator – total crypto market cap excl. leading indicators BTC/ETH.
This indicator matters simply because it excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). That’s because the two largest cryptocurrencies are great leading indicators, but tend to move slower when alts accelerate their move (typically at the start of alt season).
As seen below, we accurately predicted the start of alt season 2024 late January 2024, see chart below.
This crypto market breakout has legs. The first two targets are shown on the chart. That’s quite some upside potential before alt season 2025 gets back to its 2021 highs (where the breakout process to ATH will start).
The second indicator is Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate alt season barometer. It is now above its most important Fibonacci level, since Nov 9th, 2024, confirming alt season 2025.
We have been repeating the importance of the 50% Fibonacci level throughout all our writings since many years.
Dogecoin is clearing, convincingly, its 50% Fibonacci level, around Nov 9th, 2024.
The message is loud and clear – Dogecoin, the ultimate bullish momentum barometer among all altcoins, is starting a new bullish wave. This is the most convincing alt season 2025 signal.
The third indicator is an external one – the US Dollar, inversely correlated to crypto markets, is unable to clear its 50% Fibonacci level (so far, at least) – this raises confidence in the alt season indicators outlined above.
The US Dollar is inversely correlated to Bitcoin and altcoins.
The USD chart makes it clear – it may have bounced in October, but the bounce happened from oversold levels.
Once the USD clears 107 points, it will turn bullish. Given this current chart setup, it seems a rather low probability for the USD to turn bullish. Until the USD turns bullish, crypto can move much higher.
The 4th (and last) indicator confirming a new alt season is Shiba, the 2nd largest meme, which ideally also confirms a breakout.
Arguably, its chart suggests that it’s a matter of time, either hours or days, until SHIB clears THE most important Fibonacci level which is $.00002345.
If and when SHIB moves above this level, it will be the final indicator confirming the new bullish trend in alts.
This new alt season has legs, and will not peak before June 2025 is our thesis.
Premium crypto members were alerted ahead of the breakout – most of our token tips alts have risen between 30 to 200... [TRUNCADO]

The price band between $352-$353 has seen quite a bit of action this month. In my previous Bitcoin technical analysis article from the 13th, I explained why this area is of great technical significance and why it is crucial for the market to surmount this area in the future. When the market encountered the $353 pivot for a third time on the 26th, it briefly traded above it for a few hours, but then quickly dropped back under $353.
Although there wasn’t enough buying momentum to really smash though this major pivot zone, price has slowly made its way above $353 over the last two days. This can be observed very clearly on the 1-hour chart, which shows that the market has now used $353 as support on three occasions in the past 24h. If price makes it back under $353 again, I think it is very likely that this level will turn into resistance, and price will most likely head south.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

The cryptocurrency market is showing potential signs of an impending altcoin season. Market watchers cite a confluence of technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic factors that could lead to a significant rally in altcoins.
The outlook follows a notable downturn in the altcoin market, which has dropped about 37.6% since its high in early December 2024. As of the latest data, the market cap stands at $1.1 trillion.
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the total cryptocurrency market, seems to be at a key turning point.
A recent chart shared by crypto analyst Mister Crypto on X highlighted that Bitcoin Dominance has reached a resistance following a rising wedge pattern. This pattern is generally seen as a bearish signal, often leading to sharp pullbacks.
“Bitcoin Dominance will collapse. Altseason will come. We will all get rich this year!” he wrote.
In addition, another analyst corroborated these findings, noting that Bitcoin Dominance has reached a peak. Thus, he forecasted a subsequent downturn.
However, the Altcoin Season Index has dropped to a low of 16. The index, which analyzes the performance of the top 50 altcoins against Bitcoin, indicated that altcoins are currently underperforming.
Notably, this level mirrors the bottom for altcoins observed around August 2024. This period preceded a significant altcoin rally, and the index peaked at 88 by December 2024.
Lastly, from a macroeconomic perspective, the 90-day delay in President Donald Trump’s tariff implementation has renewed market confidence. This delay is perceived as a positive signal, potentially encouraging capital inflows into altcoins.
“90 days tariff pause = 90 days of altseason,” an analyst claimed.
Moreover, analyst Crypto Rover pointed to quantitative easing (QE) as a catalyst for an altseason. According to him, when the central bank starts pumping money into the economy (through QE), altcoins could experience a significant price surge, benefiting from the increased liquidity and investor optimism.
“Once QE starts. Altcoin season will make a massive comeback!” he stated.
However, in the latest report, Kaiko Research stressed that a traditional altcoin season may no longer be feasible. Instead, any potential rally could be selective, with only a few altcoins experiencing significant upside. The focus will likely be on assets with real-world use cases, strong liquidity, and revenue-generating potential.
“Altseasons may become a thing of the past, necessitating a more nuanced categorization beyond just ‘altcoins,’ as correlations in returns, growth factors, and liquidity among crypto assets are diverging significantly over time,” the report read.
Kaiko Research noted that the growing concentration of liquidity in a few altcoins and Bitcoin may disrupt the typical capital flow into altcoins during market upswings. Furthermore, as Bitcoin becomes more w... [TRUNCADO]

There's a widespread belief in the cyclical nature of the crypto market. According to this concept, cryptoasset dynamics often follow a recognizable pattern: Bitcoin leads, then Ethereum gains attention, and finally altcoins rise. During these periods, many high-return opportunities emerge, leaving newcomers feeling they’ve missed out.
A trader's main challenge is identifying the period of the most active altcoin growth, commonly known as altseason. However, each cycle unfolds differently and is influenced by unique market events, complicating forecasting and analysis.
Coinpaper's editorial team explored what drives altcoin growth, which metrics indicate the approach of altseason, and how to use market data for informed decisions.
Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This category includes widely known assets like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), as well as smaller projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Aave (AAVE). Analysts classify altcoins based on their use cases or functionality, though no universally accepted standard exists.
The primary difference between Bitcoin and altcoins lies in market positioning and price behavior. Bitcoin, due to its high market capitalization, is considered a "base" asset or digital gold, while altcoins tend to be more volatile and are influenced by trends, speculation, and overall market sentiment.
Based on these distinctions, the crypto community has observed a sequence of capital flow through four phases:
Although technically altseason begins in the second phase, the community typically associates it with the fourth, when a broad range of assets outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. This period is characterized by growing retail interest, heightened media activity, new project launches, and expanding market capitalization of lesser-known tokens.
While the concept of cyclical capital flows underpins altseason theory, some analysts question its reliability. Arthur Hayes, for example, argues that four-year cycles no longer hold, while Bernstein suggests a possible extension of the bullish phase.
Other factors, such as institutional activity and macroeconomic conditions, are also reshaping traditional market dynamics. With over 100,000 altcoins and 400+ asset categories tracked by CoinGecko, establishing a unified classification system remains challenging.
The Altseason Index tracks how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If over 75% of these assets grow faster than Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in altseason.
As of September 2025, the index stands at 76 points, signaling broad altcoin outperformance. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap offer similar versions, with minor differences due to calculation methods.
Historical charts of the Altseason Index reveal how capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins over time. In September 2025, the index reached 80 points, marking the altseason zone. The gradual rise in 2025 contrasts with the sharp, short-lived ... [TRUNCADO]

Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points
Altcoin Season—a period characterized by high volatility and astronomical returns where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) dramatically outperform the market leader—is the most anticipated event in the crypto world. Successfully Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points is crucial for maximizing profit while minimizing exposure to the inevitable sharp retracements. This intense phase, often lasting several weeks to a few months, is not a random event but a predictable cycle driven by capital flow, market psychology, and measurable quantitative metrics. Understanding the rhythm of this cycle is essential for any serious investor looking to capitalize on the next major wave, as detailed further in our comprehensive guide, Navigating the Altcoin Market: Investment Strategies, Altcoin Season Cycles, and Top Crypto Picks for 2025.
Altcoin Season is not a switch that flips overnight; it is the culmination of a multi-stage process that typically follows Bitcoin’s strong rally phase. Capital generally flows through the crypto ecosystem in a predictable manner:
Successful timing relies on analyzing specific, quantifiable metrics that track capital flow and market health. These indicators act as leading signals for entry and exit.
Bitcoin Dominance is arguably the single most critical metric. It represents the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
The Total Altcoin Market Cap (often charted as TOTAL2, which excludes BTC) provides a clearer picture of the sheer volume of capital flowing into the alternative sector.
The true measure of Altcoin Season is the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin.
Timing the exact start of Altcoin Season is impossible, but strategic investors position themselves during the optimal accumulation window—the period of low conviction and high fear preceding the dominance shift.
Rather than trying to catch the first green candle, employ a staged accumulation strategy:
Sector Rotation Insight: Entry timing can be further refined by watching sector rotation. Early Alt Seasons often favor foundational layers (L1s, scaling solutions, infrastructure). As the season matures, capital flows into riskier, narrative-driven sectors like meme coins, Gaming/Metaverse, or new AI applications (The Rise of AI and DeFi Altcoins: Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks).
The failure to execute a disciplined exit strategy is the number one reason investors lose profits during the volatile Altcoin Season. The peak is marked by extreme euphoria and irrational price action.
The final stage requires investors to ignore FOMO and focus purely on exit signals:
Instead of selling everything at one target, use a staggered, quantitative approach:
This strategy ensures you capture profits along the way and prevents the entire portfolio from collapsing during the inevitable ... [TRUNCADO]

Altcoin Season Predictions and Analysis 2025: Complete Market Cycle Guide
Altcoin seasons represent periods of significant outperformance by alternative cryptocurrencies relative to Bitcoin, creating substantial opportunities and risks for investors. This comprehensive analysis explores the mechanics of altcoin cycles, current market conditions, and strategic approaches for navigating the dynamic altcoin landscape in 2025.
An altcoin season occurs when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin over a sustained period, typically characterized by:
Bitcoin rallies establish crypto legitimacy, institutional interest validates the space, early adopters rotate profits into altcoins, smart money begins accumulation
Media coverage increases awareness, retail investors enter seeking higher returns, FOMO drives indiscriminate buying, new projects launch to capture attention
Extreme speculation and valuations, quality projects mixed with obvious scams, maximum retail participation, influencer promotion reaches peak
Reality sets in regarding valuations, weak projects collapse rapidly, flight to quality (Bitcoin, major altcoins), market sentiment turns negative
Professional market makers now provide liquidity for altcoins:
For comprehensive altcoin season tracking and analysis tools, [CoinCryptoRank](/altcoin-season) provides real-time sector rotation monitoring, Bitcoin dominance analysis, and emerging opportunity identification.
Explore our altcoin season tracker and market analysis tools to stay ahead of market cycles.
The optimal time is during Bitcoin dominance peaks (>60%) when altcoins are undervalued relative to Bitcoin. Start with quality, large-cap altcoins and gradually add smaller positions as the altcoin season develops. Avoid buying during peak euphoria when dominance is <40%.
Focus on projects with strong fundamentals: active development, real utility, growing user base, and clear value propositions. Look for sectors with emerging narratives (AI, RWA, gaming) and projects solving actual problems. Avoid projects that are purely speculative or have unclear use cases.
Conservative investors should limit altcoins to 10-30% of crypto allocation, with the remainder in Bitcoin and Ethereum. More aggressive investors might allocate 30-60% to altcoins, but never more than you can afford to lose. Consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and overall financial situation.
Warning signs include Bitcoin dominance falling below 35%, obvious scam projects succeeding, mainstream media euphoria, and extreme price predictions becoming common. Technical indicators like RSI above 80 on major altcoins and parabolic price moves also suggest cycle peaks.
Most altcoins lose 80-95% of their value in bear markets. Only hold high-conviction, fundamentally strong projects through downturns. Consider taking profits during bull markets and reallocating to Bitcoin/stablecoins for bear market preservation, then reaccumulate quality altcoins at lowe... [TRUNCADO]

Devconnect Buenos Aires wrapped up as the largest Ethereum Foundation event yet, bringing together a global mix of developers, founders, creators, and curious newcomers.
Q3 2025 brought an exciting wave of innovation and community energy! Explore the projects we funded this quarter and the work they’re advancing:
Disclaimer: The following blog is a proposal from the Account Abstraction team. Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum.

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever. Ethereum has scaled through rollups, where blockspace is abundant and transactions are cheap. The challenge now is not just throughput, but seamless user experience across that multichain horizon.

What if all the L2s felt like a single, unified Ethereum?

No bridges to think about, no chain names to recognize, no fragmented balances or assets.

That’s the vision of the **Ethereum Interop
Ethereum’s weekly All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-6 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.



If you enjoy reading core development updates, you may also be keen to learn that Forkcast now publishes call summaries, chats and transcripts for each All Core Devs call, usually available within a couple hours of the call.
Fusaka follows this year's Pectra upgrade, representing a major step forward in Ethereum's scaling roadmap that improves L1 performance, increases blob throughput, and enhances user experience.

The Fusaka network upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Ethereum mainnet at slot 13,164,544 (December 3, 2025, 21:49:11 UTC). Fusaka also introduces Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks to safely scale blob throughput after PeerDAS activation. These are minimal, config-only upgrades that adjust the blob target/max and fee update fraction. See the activation table below for further details.

The Fusaka mainnet client releases are listed below.
In two weeks, we open the doors to the first-ever Ethereum World’s Fair at La Rural in Buenos Aires.

This year isn’t about someday. It’s about now. On Ethereum today you can pay, play, vote, save, borrow, lend, and chat, all onchain — and at Devconnect you’ll experience that shift hands-on, IRL.
Buenos Aires is the right backdrop for this moment: a city where crypto is part of daily life and where builders are ready to show what’s live.

Below is your guide to what’s inside the fairgrounds, how to plan your week, and what to do before you arrive.
Over the past few years, the Ethereum ecosystem has grown in depth, diversity, and maturity. Builders and communities worldwide have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new tools, pr... [TRUNCADO]

While a poll suggested that the percentage of crypto ownership dropped in the UK, the amount of digital assets held increased, with a majority reporting Bitcoin and Ether holdings.
Bitcoin liquidity grabs continued at the Wall Street open, with traders hoping that a breakthrough of resistance would propel the BTC price toward the $100,000 zone.
Ether price wobbled as weak onchain activity, low futures demand and aggressive selling by holders favored a potential ETH price drop to $2,300.
According to Delphi Digital, Crypto exchanges are racing to become the home screen for trading, payments and Web3.

>>> FUENTE: https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-technical-analysis-for-11282015-big-battle-at-353/
The price band between $352-$353 has seen quite a bit of action this month. In my previous Bitcoin technical analysis article from the 13th, I explained why this area is of great technical significance and why it is crucial for the market to surmount this area in the future. When the market encountered the $353 pivot for a third time on the 26th, it briefly traded above it for a few hours, but then quickly dropped back under $353.
Although there wasn’t enough buying momentum to really smash though this major pivot zone, price has slowly made its way above $353 over the last two days. This can be observed very clearly on the 1-hour chart, which shows that the market has now used $353 as support on three occasions in the past 24h. If price makes it back under $353 again, I think it is very likely that this level will turn into resistance, and price will most likely head south.

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Consequently, there has been an explosion in user-generated ass... [TRUNCADO]

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index (RSI) compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, especially when used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1
+

Average gain
Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(


1
%

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

Home » Crypto & Blockchain » Crypto Alert – Alt Season 2025 Is Here
Crypto alt season 2025 officially started on November 9th, 2024.
Three indicators confirm crypto alt season 2025 started on November 9th: crypto total market cap excl. BTC and ETH breaks out, Dogecoin clears its 50% Fibonacci level, the USD remains below 107 points.
In this article, we review 3 out of the 4 indicators that are screaming ALT SEASON 2025 is here.
Interestingly, the 4th indicator is testing a breakout, so it might be a matter of hours or days until all alt season 2025 confirmations are in!
First alt season indicator – total crypto market cap excl. leading indicators BTC/ETH.
This indicator matters simply because it excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). That’s because the two largest cryptocurrencies are great leading indicators, but tend to move slower when alts accelerate their move (typically at the start of alt season).
As seen below, we accurately predicted the start of alt season 2024 late January 2024, see chart below.
This crypto market breakout has legs. The first two targets are shown on the chart. That’s quite some upside potential before alt season 2025 gets back to its 2021 highs (where the breakout process to ATH will start).
The second indicator is Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate alt season barometer. It is now above its most important Fibonacci level, since Nov 9th, 2024, confirming alt season 2025.
We have been repeating the importance of the 50% Fibonacci level throughout all our writings since many years.
Dogecoin is clearing, convincingly, its 50% Fibonacci level, around Nov 9th, 2024.
The message is loud and clear – Dogecoin, the ultimate bullish momentum barometer among all altcoins, is starting a new bullish wave. This is the most convincing alt season 2025 signal.
The third indicator is an external one – the US Dollar, inversely correlated to crypto markets, is unable to clear its 50% Fibonacci level (so far, at least) – this raises confidence in the alt season indicators outlined above.
The US Dollar is inversely correlated to Bitcoin and altcoins.
The USD chart makes it clear – it may have bounced in October, but the bounce happened from oversold levels.
Once the USD clears 107 points, it will turn bullish. Given this current chart setup, it seems a rather low probability for the USD to turn bullish. Until the USD turns bullish, crypto can move much higher.
The 4th (and last) indicator confirming a new alt season is Shiba, the 2nd largest meme, which ideally also confirms a breakout.
Arguably, its chart suggests that it’s a matter of time, either hours or days, until SHIB clears THE most important Fibonacci level which is $.00002345.
If and when SHIB moves above this level, it will be the final indicator confirming the new bullish trend in alts.
This new alt season has legs, and will not peak before June 2025 is our thesis.
Premium crypto members were alerted ahead of the breakout – most of our token tips alts have risen between 30 to 200... [TRUNCADO]

Altcoin Season Timing: Analysts Map Key Triggers for 2025 Rally
Altcoin Season Timing: Analysts Map Key Triggers for 2025 Rally
Market analysts are tracking Bitcoin dominance and gold resistance levels as key indicators for the next altcoin season. Recent analysis suggests specific conditions must align before alternative cryptocurrencies begin their expected major rally.
Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards emphasizes that true altcoin season occurs only when Bitcoin dominance breaks below 60%. This metric currently trades within a defined channel, indicating the market remains in early to mid-phase of the bull run. Bitcoin continues to attract institutional capital before funds rotate into smaller cryptocurrencies.
Every couple of weeks the same narrative: "Altseason is here!" I've fallen for this myself and been proven wrong multiple times. That's the truth, posted moon charts here as well.
However, I know the time will come, the… https://t.co/aBmXnbYEdc pic.twitter.com/uf6YArwDcA
The analyst warns against premature altcoin buying based on hype. Instead, strategic accumulation should occur only at extreme oversold levels when the Relative Strength Index drops below 25-30 on 4-hour or daily timeframes. These conditions typically produce 50% to 200% rebounds in altcoin prices.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe identifies gold’s performance near $3,365 resistance as a critical factor for altcoin direction. Gold’s failure to break this level could trigger capital rotation into risk assets including altcoins. A gold breakout above resistance might cause altcoin corrections as investors move to traditional safe havens.
It did test the resistance zone and failed to break through it.
Monitoring this chart in the upcoming week as we're facing a pivotal moment.
This correlation between gold and digital assets reflects broader market sentiment. When gold struggles at resistance, risk appetite often increases, benefiting alternative cryptocurrencies. The relationship demonstrates how traditional financial markets influence crypto pricing dynamics.
Analyst Ahmed, known as CryptoBheem, updates his altcoin market cap outlook following recent price action. The total altcoin market cap bottomed at $800 billion rather than his earlier $750 billion target. This revision reflects stronger support levels than initially expected.
It bottomed at $800B & I’ve been slightly off with the $750B bottom target.
From here wether $750-700B comes or not is dependent on dominance. It’s inside an area of extremely big levels of mean reversion.
Summing it up all together, from what I’ve been… https://t.co/wUpxM3Ngii pic.twitter.com/gytWYFwUHY
Bitcoin dominance currently sits within a mean reversion zone. This technical position suggests either further altcoin weakness or the start of a new upward cycle. The dominance metric tracks capital allocation between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

The crypto market moves in cycles, and altcoin season—when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin—remains one of the most anticipated phases. As we move through 2025, investors and traders alike are wondering: when will the next altcoin season begin?
Bitcoin experiences strong price appreciation, attracting capital into the market.
Traders rotate profits into altcoins, triggering widespread rallies.
However, timing this cycle depends on multiple factors, including liquidity conditions, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance.
One of the most reliable indicators for altcoin season is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)—the percentage of total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high (above 50%), Bitcoin is leading the market. But when it starts declining sharply, capital often flows into altcoins.
As of early 2025, Bitcoin dominance remains relatively high, which suggests altcoin season has not yet begun. However, traders are watching for a breakdown below key support levels as a potential trigger.
The Role of interest rates and Quantitative Tightening for Altcoin season
Unlike previous bull cycles, 2025 presents a unique challenge: Quantitative Tightening (QT) and high interest rates. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been withdrawing liquidity from the financial system by reducing their balance sheets and keeping interest rates elevated.
This is a stark contrast to the liquidity-driven rally of 2020–2021 when altcoins thrived in an environment of low interest rates and aggressive money printing. If tightening continues, speculative assets like altcoins could struggle to gain momentum.
However, if economic conditions force central banks to pivot towards a more accommodative stance (such as rate cuts or slowing QT), risk assets—including altcoins—could see a surge in demand.
Apart from macroeconomic trends, specific crypto-market triggers could signal the start of altcoin season in 2025:
Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has led the altcoin rally. A breakout in ETH/BTC would signal that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, marking the start of altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s continued improvements in scalability—such as Layer-2 adoption and the upcoming Pectra upgrade—could provide the infrastructure for a broader altcoin surge.

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels like 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence has its roots enshrined in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, Liber Abaci, popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields like science, nature, architecture, and finance, especially because of its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms have Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, for oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and co... [TRUNCADO]

Devconnect Buenos Aires wrapped up as the largest Ethereum Foundation event yet, bringing together a global mix of developers, founders, creators, and curious newcomers.
Q3 2025 brought an exciting wave of innovation and community energy! Explore the projects we funded this quarter and the work they’re advancing:
Disclaimer: The following blog is a proposal from the Account Abstraction team. Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum.

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever. Ethereum has scaled through rollups, where blockspace is abundant and transactions are cheap. The challenge now is not just throughput, but seamless user experience across that multichain horizon.

What if all the L2s felt like a single, unified Ethereum?

No bridges to think about, no chain names to recognize, no fragmented balances or assets.

That’s the vision of the **Ethereum Interop
Ethereum’s weekly All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-6 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.



If you enjoy reading core development updates, you may also be keen to learn that Forkcast now publishes call summaries, chats and transcripts for each All Core Devs call, usually available within a couple hours of the call.
Fusaka follows this year's Pectra upgrade, representing a major step forward in Ethereum's scaling roadmap that improves L1 performance, increases blob throughput, and enhances user experience.

The Fusaka network upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Ethereum mainnet at slot 13,164,544 (December 3, 2025, 21:49:11 UTC). Fusaka also introduces Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks to safely scale blob throughput after PeerDAS activation. These are minimal, config-only upgrades that adjust the blob target/max and fee update fraction. See the activation table below for further details.

The Fusaka mainnet client releases are listed below.
In two weeks, we open the doors to the first-ever Ethereum World’s Fair at La Rural in Buenos Aires.

This year isn’t about someday. It’s about now. On Ethereum today you can pay, play, vote, save, borrow, lend, and chat, all onchain — and at Devconnect you’ll experience that shift hands-on, IRL.
Buenos Aires is the right backdrop for this moment: a city where crypto is part of daily life and where builders are ready to show what’s live.

Below is your guide to what’s inside the fairgrounds, how to plan your week, and what to do before you arrive.
Over the past few years, the Ethereum ecosystem has grown in depth, diversity, and maturity. Builders and communities worldwide have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new tools, pr... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin appreciated tremendously during the last few months of 2015, but the trend is beginning to shift. The 4-hour chart is clearly showing that the market started to print lower-highs, and also lower-lows, towards the end of December. The trading channel is now starting to curve lower and this kind of price action is very suggestive of an impending bear market.
For speculators, the $433 price level has become a major battle zone. This pivot has acted as support/resistance several times during the second half of December. If price breaks above $433 and trades near the $440 level for some time; $433 will most likely turn into support again.
A failure to break above $433 will most likely result in another plunge towards the big pivot area between $405-$406. This price level was respected on multiple occasions last month, so it is of great technical significance. And sell-off will most likely stall near this range.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

>>> FUENTE: https://coinpaper.com/11193/5-signs-the-2025-altseason-could-be-bigger-than-ever
There's a widespread belief in the cyclical nature of the crypto market. According to this concept, cryptoasset dynamics often follow a recognizable pattern: Bitcoin leads, then Ethereum gains attention, and finally altcoins rise. During these periods, many high-return opportunities emerge, leaving newcomers feeling they’ve missed out.
A trader's main challenge is identifying the period of the most active altcoin growth, commonly known as altseason. However, each cycle unfolds differently and is influenced by unique market events, complicating forecasting and analysis.
Coinpaper's editorial team explored what drives altcoin growth, which metrics indicate the approach of altseason, and how to use market data for informed decisions.
Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This category includes widely known assets like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), as well as smaller projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Aave (AAVE). Analysts classify altcoins based on their use cases or functionality, though no universally accepted standard exists.
The primary difference between Bitcoin and altcoins lies in market positioning and price behavior. Bitcoin, due to its high market capitalization, is considered a "base" asset or digital gold, while altcoins tend to be more volatile and are influenced by trends, speculation, and overall market sentiment.
Based on these distinctions, the crypto community has observed a sequence of capital flow through four phases:
Although technically altseason begins in the second phase, the community typically associates it with the fourth, when a broad range of assets outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. This period is characterized by growing retail interest, heightened media activity, new project launches, and expanding market capitalization of lesser-known tokens.
While the concept of cyclical capital flows underpins altseason theory, some analysts question its reliability. Arthur Hayes, for example, argues that four-year cycles no longer hold, while Bernstein suggests a possible extension of the bullish phase.
Other factors, such as institutional activity and macroeconomic conditions, are also reshaping traditional market dynamics. With over 100,000 altcoins and 400+ asset categories tracked by CoinGecko, establishing a unified classification system remains challenging.
The Altseason Index tracks how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If over 75% of these assets grow faster than Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in altseason.
As of September 2025, the index stands at 76 points, signaling broad altcoin outperformance. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap offer similar versions, with minor differences due to calculation methods.
Historical charts of the Altseason Index reveal how capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins over time. In September 2025, the index reached 80 points, marking the altseason zone. The gradual rise in 2025 contrasts with the sharp, short-lived ... [TRUNCADO]

Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points
Altcoin Season—a period characterized by high volatility and astronomical returns where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) dramatically outperform the market leader—is the most anticipated event in the crypto world. Successfully Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points is crucial for maximizing profit while minimizing exposure to the inevitable sharp retracements. This intense phase, often lasting several weeks to a few months, is not a random event but a predictable cycle driven by capital flow, market psychology, and measurable quantitative metrics. Understanding the rhythm of this cycle is essential for any serious investor looking to capitalize on the next major wave, as detailed further in our comprehensive guide, Navigating the Altcoin Market: Investment Strategies, Altcoin Season Cycles, and Top Crypto Picks for 2025.
Altcoin Season is not a switch that flips overnight; it is the culmination of a multi-stage process that typically follows Bitcoin’s strong rally phase. Capital generally flows through the crypto ecosystem in a predictable manner:
Successful timing relies on analyzing specific, quantifiable metrics that track capital flow and market health. These indicators act as leading signals for entry and exit.
Bitcoin Dominance is arguably the single most critical metric. It represents the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
The Total Altcoin Market Cap (often charted as TOTAL2, which excludes BTC) provides a clearer picture of the sheer volume of capital flowing into the alternative sector.
The true measure of Altcoin Season is the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin.
Timing the exact start of Altcoin Season is impossible, but strategic investors position themselves during the optimal accumulation window—the period of low conviction and high fear preceding the dominance shift.
Rather than trying to catch the first green candle, employ a staged accumulation strategy:
Sector Rotation Insight: Entry timing can be further refined by watching sector rotation. Early Alt Seasons often favor foundational layers (L1s, scaling solutions, infrastructure). As the season matures, capital flows into riskier, narrative-driven sectors like meme coins, Gaming/Metaverse, or new AI applications (The Rise of AI and DeFi Altcoins: Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks).
The failure to execute a disciplined exit strategy is the number one reason investors lose profits during the volatile Altcoin Season. The peak is marked by extreme euphoria and irrational price action.
The final stage requires investors to ignore FOMO and focus purely on exit signals:
Instead of selling everything at one target, use a staggered, quantitative approach:
This strategy ensures you capture profits along the way and prevents the entire portfolio from collapsing during the inevitable ... [TRUNCADO]

=== 🧠 CONCIENCIA DE MERCADO (2025-12-31 12:57:23) ===

>>> FUENTE: https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/
The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

The CMC Altcoin Season Index page provides real-time insights into whether the cryptocurrency market is currently in Altcoin Season, based on the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days, with detailed charts and metrics for tracking market trends and altcoin dominance.
During Altcoin Season, several distinct market characteristics emerge:
Increased Altcoin Dominance: Altcoins collectively gain prominence in the cryptocurrency market. In the recent Altcoin Season in May 2021, the combined market capitalization of the top 100 altcoins reached around 130% of Bitcoin's.
﻿﻿Rapid Price Appreciation: Altcoins experience significant price increases across the board, often outpacing the growth of Bitcoin. For example, large-cap altcoin prices achieved 174% returns versus BTC's 2% during the Altcoin Season from February to May 2021. Many narratives pop up and are not limited to just one or two trends.
FOMO: Overall market sentiment during Altcoin Season is typically bullish, driven by optimism about the potential for altcoins to deliver substantial returns. FOMO mentality is evidenced by high 24-hour trade volume across all large-cap coins, leading to increased buying pressure and price momentum.

>>> FUENTE: https://tangem.com/en/blog/post/what-is-altseason/
Altseason is a period when capital flows from Bitcoin to altcoins, resulting in rapid price increases and heightened volatility across the cryptocurrency market. In September 2025, altseason is actively underway, marked by declining Bitcoin dominance, rising altcoin trading volumes, and strong institutional interest in Ethereum and other alts. While altseasons can offer significant profit opportunities, they are unpredictable, short-lived, and come with increased risks, making research and secure asset storage essential for participants.
Altseason refers to a short time frame when capital shifts from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins or alts, leading to a notable and rapid rise in the prices of most cryptocurrencies. Altcoin season, commonly known as 'Altseason', is characterized by massive gains and high volatility. It's essentially a great time for non-bitcoin maxis.During a relatively brief period—typically weeks or months—the values of altcoins soar as investors move their funds from Bitcoin to other coins. As prices begin to climb and the altcoin season index trends upward, FOMO—fear of missing out—investments come into play. This creates a cascading effect that further drives altcoin prices to extraordinary levels for a limited time.
After a substantial increase in Bitcoin's price, it tends to stabilize and move sideways for a while. This situation persuades investors to search for more profitable opportunities. They often exchange their BTC for Ethereum(ETH) and other promising alts, decreasing Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market and triggering an altseason.
At the end of October, the market’s Fear and Greed Index was at 29, indicating ongoing fear. This mood has persisted for three straight weeks since the liquidation event on October 11. Fear has led investors to hold back. On a positive note, most altcoins are now trading within stable price ranges, without hitting new lows.As more Fed rate cuts occur, investors may feel more confident in exploring higher-risk assets, such as altcoins, especially as capital shifts from Bitcoin to the broader crypto market. That said, based on social media buzz, it seems a big altcoin season is probably not on the horizon this month.
Previous alt seasons have significantly increased various altcoin values, with some achieving exponential rises in relatively brief timeframes.
Noteworthy alt seasons include the trends of 2017-2018 and 2020-2021. Let's examine them more closely.
This alt-season was driven by a substantial reduction in Bitcoin's market dominance, which dropped from 86.3% in late 2017 to a low of 38.69% at the beginning of 2018. During this time, Bitcoin's price fell from a then-historic peak above $20,000 to below $6,000 just a few months later.
The rise of altcoins surpassing BTC occurred as the initial coin offering (ICO) market was booming in 2017-2018. Many blockchain projects launched ICOs to gather funds by creating tokens.
The alt season of 2020-2021 emerged during the coronavirus pand... [TRUNCADO]

This Devcon 8 update is not a full vision, but will help organizers and the wider ecosystem plan. More details on programming, tracks, and participation will follow in the coming months.
Fusaka shipped PeerDAS in addition to a myriad of minor features and Glamsterdam’s major features will include Block-level Access Lists and enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation.

Now we begin outlining the subsequent upgrade: Hegotá.
Thanks to Arantxa Zapico, Benedikt Wagner, and Dmitry Khovratovich from the EF cryptography team for their contributions, and to Ladislaus, Kev, Alex, and Marius for the careful review and feedback.

The zkEVM ecosystem has been sprinting for a year. And it worked! We crossed the finish line for real-time proving!

Now comes the next phase: building something mainnet-grade.

Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum. Special thanks to Ladislaus von Daniels and Marius van der Wijden for reviewing this article.

Ethereum has grown from a small experimental network into a critical piece of global infrastructure. Every day it settles billions of dollars in value, coordinates thousands of applications, and anchors an entire ecosystem of L2s.

All of this ultimately relies on a single underlying component: state.
Devconnect Buenos Aires wrapped up as the largest Ethereum Foundation event yet, bringing together a global mix of developers, founders, creators, and curious newcomers.
Q3 2025 brought an exciting wave of innovation and community energy! Explore the projects we funded this quarter and the work they’re advancing:
Disclaimer: The following blog is a proposal from the Account Abstraction team. Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum.

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever. Ethereum has scaled through rollups, where blockspace is abundant and transactions are cheap. The challenge now is not just throughput, but seamless user experience across that multichain horizon.

What if all the L2s felt like a single, unified Ethereum?

No bridges to think about, no chain names to recognize, no fragmented balances or assets.

That’s the vision of the **Ethereum Interop
Ethereum’s weekly All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-6 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1
+

Average gain
Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(


1
%

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Consequently, there has been an explosion in user-generated ass... [TRUNCADO]

The crypto market moves in cycles, and altcoin season—when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin—remains one of the most anticipated phases. As we move through 2025, investors and traders alike are wondering: when will the next altcoin season begin?
Bitcoin experiences strong price appreciation, attracting capital into the market.
Traders rotate profits into altcoins, triggering widespread rallies.
However, timing this cycle depends on multiple factors, including liquidity conditions, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance.
One of the most reliable indicators for altcoin season is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)—the percentage of total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high (above 50%), Bitcoin is leading the market. But when it starts declining sharply, capital often flows into altcoins.
As of early 2025, Bitcoin dominance remains relatively high, which suggests altcoin season has not yet begun. However, traders are watching for a breakdown below key support levels as a potential trigger.
The Role of interest rates and Quantitative Tightening for Altcoin season
Unlike previous bull cycles, 2025 presents a unique challenge: Quantitative Tightening (QT) and high interest rates. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been withdrawing liquidity from the financial system by reducing their balance sheets and keeping interest rates elevated.
This is a stark contrast to the liquidity-driven rally of 2020–2021 when altcoins thrived in an environment of low interest rates and aggressive money printing. If tightening continues, speculative assets like altcoins could struggle to gain momentum.
However, if economic conditions force central banks to pivot towards a more accommodative stance (such as rate cuts or slowing QT), risk assets—including altcoins—could see a surge in demand.
Apart from macroeconomic trends, specific crypto-market triggers could signal the start of altcoin season in 2025:
Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has led the altcoin rally. A breakout in ETH/BTC would signal that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, marking the start of altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s continued improvements in scalability—such as Layer-2 adoption and the upcoming Pectra upgrade—could provide the infrastructure for a broader altcoin surge.

CoinGecko is a leading cryptocurrency price & data platform providing real-time prices & market data for verified cryptocurrencies, NFT collections & exchanges. We provide the most comprehensive and most accurate data for thousands of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin & Ethereum, and thousands of NFT collections. Prices & market data are aggregated from millions of individual markets across thousands of centralized & decentralized exchanges, including popular ones such as CoinBase, Binance, Uniswap, and more.
As crypto traders and investors ourselves, we understand the hassle of browsing multiple websites and exchanges to find reliable information and market data for a coin. That’s why we built CoinGecko – to democratize access to cryptocurrency data and empower users with actionable insights, so you can access all information in one place and make informed decisions in your investment & trading journey.
Crypto prices and market data have always been at the core of our product – it’s what we do best. We provide unbiased cryptocurrency data for the community, whether to help you make an investment decision or check the value of your crypto assets. Crypto prices on an exchange are driven by market condition, influenced by factors like liquidity, trading pairs, offerings, and economic conditions. As exchanges may sometimes show abnormal prices, the crypto community relies on CoinGecko to track prices accurately.
Crypto prices alone don’t mean much, so we’ve included data like market cap and fully diluted value. It’s only when you pair current prices with historical data, statistics, news, and more that you get a full picture of a coin’s performance. Another popular feature on CoinGecko is our free and powerful crypto charts. What’s neat is you can compare a coin’s performance against Bitcoin and/or Ethereum on a single graph, and can view all key metrics on one chart - price, market cap & trading volume.
Our prices are calculated using an average price formula based on available trading pairs across multiple exchanges. We also have algorithms to detect and exclude anomalous tickers from our prices. Learn more about our methodology.
Beyond USD-denominated prices, you may also track prices in your local currency and your local language. Popular examples for Bitcoin include BTC-AUD, BTC-CAD, BTC-GBP, BTC-INR, and more.
Crypto market cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency in circulation, calculated by multiplying the total number of coins by the current market price. It’s used to determine the valuation of a cryptocurrency based on the total money invested, not just the price. A cryptocurrency's market cap is important and often relied upon by investors to value cryptocurrencies through a standardized metric. It is often used to determine if a coin has more room for growth or is currently overvalued by comparing it to established cryptocurrencies with similar use cases as a benchmark. While market cap is important, it’s only one of many factors to ... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.
Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.
On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”
Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.
However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.
Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.
Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to ap... [TRUNCADO]

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

>>> FUENTE: https://www.okx.com/es-la/learn/altcoin-season-2025-trends-metrics-narratives
Altcoin season, commonly referred to as "altseason," is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins—cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin—outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. This phenomenon is typically marked by a decline in Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. During altcoin season, traders and investors shift their focus to altcoins, driving heightened trading volumes and significant price increases across the altcoin market.
Altcoin season represents a unique opportunity for traders and investors to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the explosive growth of altcoins. Understanding the dynamics of altseason can help market participants make informed decisions and maximize returns.
Bitcoin dominance is a critical factor in determining the performance of altcoins. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it often suppresses altcoin growth as most capital flows into Bitcoin. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance drops below key thresholds, such as 50%, altcoins tend to thrive. This shift in dominance signals increased retail and institutional interest in altcoins, often marking the onset of altcoin season.
Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained drop below 50% is a strong indicator of altcoin season.
Altcoin Trading Volume: Increased trading activity in altcoins suggests growing market interest.
Social Media Trends: Heightened discussions and trends around altcoins on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram often precede altcoin rallies.
Bitcoin halving events, which occur approximately every four years, are significant catalysts for cryptocurrency market cycles. These events reduce the block reward for miners, effectively decreasing Bitcoin's supply issuance. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have triggered bull runs, with altcoin rallies typically following Bitcoin's price surges. As Bitcoin's price stabilizes post-halving, investors often seek higher returns in altcoins, setting the stage for altcoin season.
Post-Halving Stability: As Bitcoin's price stabilizes, capital flows into altcoins.
Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around Bitcoin often spills over into the altcoin market.
The growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has reshaped market dynamics. While developments like Bitcoin spot ETFs have strengthened Bitcoin dominance, institutional capital inflows into altcoins are becoming increasingly significant. Pro-crypto regulations and emerging narratives could catalyze a unique altcoin season in 2025.
Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations around altcoins could attract institutional investors.
Emerging Narratives: Sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization are gaining traction among institutional players.
Portfolio Diversification: As the cryptocurrency market matures, institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include altcoins.

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Consequently, there has been an explosion in user-generated ass... [TRUNCADO]

With monetary policy, liquidity, regulation, and institutional demand all in flux, analysts say the answer may depend on how these forces unfold quarter by quarter next year.
Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Sygnum Bank, believes the opening months of 2026 could be broadly supportive for bitcoin (BTC-USD), driven by improving macro conditions and easing fear across crypto markets.
“Overall, we see various fundamental, sentiment and regulatory drivers that from a historical perspective should be supportive for bitcoin (BTC-USD) over the next 6–9 months,” Dori told Yahoo Finance UK, while stressing that the timing of these forces remains uncertain.
He points to signs of an accelerating business cycle, with purchasing managers’ indices improving and liquidity conditions easing as quantitative tightening ends and US Treasury account balances normalise. At the same time, Dori expects sentiment in crypto markets to stabilise after the end of 2025's period of heightened fear, encouraging greater activity across trading, staking, and decentralised finance.
“If crypto markets remain stable, concerns of the four-year cycle repeating itself decline, further improving sentiment,” he said, adding that progress on US regulation, particularly the potential passage of the Clarity Act, could also bolster confidence.
Still, he cautioned that risks remain, noting that a potential US government shutdown could trigger short-term volatility.
The Clarity Act is a proposed piece of US legislation aimed at defining which digital assets fall under securities laws and which are treated as commodities, reducing long-standing regulatory ambiguity for crypto firms and investors. Supporters argue it would provide clearer rules for exchanges, issuers, and decentralised protocols, potentially accelerating institutional adoption if passed.
However, the range of possible outcomes for bitcoin (BTC-USD) in 2026 is already drawing starkly different forecasts. Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has warned that a sharp reversal remains on the table, suggesting bitcoin could fall back toward $50,000 alongside a broader normalisation across risk assets.
In a post on X, McGlone framed the outlook in relative terms, writing: “Normal Reversion May Get $50,000 Bitcoin, 5,000 Beta, Bitcoin heading toward $50,000...” His view reflects a broader thesis that shifting macro dynamics, including a possible deflationary adjustment in equities relative to hard assets, could weigh on both stocks and digital assets, even as longer-term adoption trends remain intact.

Bitcoin (BTC) was invented by a pseudonymous individual or group named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and is the world’s first enduring cryptocurrency that succeeded where decades of digital cash experiments failed.
Bitcoin’s monetary policy is enforced through a unique blend of software, cryptography and financial incentives rather than the whim of trusted third parties. The Bitcoin network is powered by a cryptographically secure, verifiable database called the blockchain — itself a technological phenomenon.
The Bitcoin ecosystem consists of a global network of stakeholders, including the miners that secure the network and drive the issuance of the Bitcoin currency, the traders who speculate on this radically market-driven asset, and the builders working to onboard people to the cryptocurrency paradigm.
At Cointelegraph, we are chronicling the ongoing story of Bitcoin and the rise of a borderless, permissionless financial system. What has changed since Satoshi wrote the Bitcoin white paper? How is Bitcoin trading developing over the years, what are the best ways of investing in Bitcoin, and how do Bitcoin futures influence blockchain adoption? How will industry stakeholders work to make Bitcoin a mainstay in people’s lives, and will incumbent and legacy systems accept or fight this change?

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1
+

Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(


1
%

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

Will Prediction Market Volumes Continue to Grow? Bull vs Bear Case | Messari Fully Diluted
The Messari team analyzes prediction markets after the Super Bowl drove record volumes across Kalshi and Polymarket. With $6.2 billion in weekly volume split between sports betting and political markets, the question is whether this represents a local top or sustainable growth. Will prediction markets scale to entertainment, culture, and long-tail markets, or is volume topping out? The discussion covers regulatory advantages, UX challenges, and whether Robin Hood and Coinbase building their own platforms will threaten Kalshi and Polymarket's market share.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1
+

Average gain
Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(


1
%

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

>>> FUENTE: https://tetrabitcoin.com/altcoin-season-signals-for-november-3-key/
The crypto market loves a good seasonal story, and November has historically delivered some of the most dramatic plot twists. For many traders, the phrase altcoin season evokes images of mid-caps ripping, micro-caps doubling overnight, and liquidity rotating away from the orange coin into a sprawling crypto market of narratives—DeFi, Layer-2, AI tokens, gaming, and beyond. Yet relying on vibes rarely ends well. If you want to approach November with a research-driven edge, it helps to understand the concrete, testable conditions that tend to precede an Altcoin Season Signals rally.
In this guide, we unpack three indicators that often appear before—or alongside—the emergence of an Altcoin Season Signals season: a rollover in Bitcoin dominance, a sustained improvement in market breadth, and a rise in on-chain activity that confirms real users are returning to networks. We’ll also look at how seasonality can shape expectations without becoming a crutch, and we’ll link to reputable tools so you can track these signals for yourself.
Before we dive in, a quick framing: no single metric “calls” the market. The useful mindset is mosaic theory—multiple independent signals that, together, build conviction. Read these indicators as evidence, not certainty, and combine them with your own risk management.
It’s tempting to lean entirely on calendar lore. Historically, November has been a strong month for Bitcoin on average, a pattern highlighted in multiple analyses referencing CoinGlass’s monthly returns. The average November gain across certain sample periods is unusually high, which helps explain why confidence often builds into Q4 rallies.
Still, dispersion is enormous: standout years like 2013 and 2020 skew the averages, and some Novembers have been outright rough. Treat seasonality as a tailwind, not a trading system. Seasonality alone doesn’t tell you when altcoin season might start. For that, we look at structural signals that reflect how market participants are actually allocating capital and using networks. Let’s break down the three most actionable ones.
Bitcoin dominance—BTC’s share of total crypto market capitalization—is one of the cleanest top-down gauges of whether capital is concentrated in Bitcoin or dispersing into altcoins. When dominance trends higher, market participants are typically seeking the relative safety and liquidity of BTC. When dominance stalls or rolls over, it often signals the early stages of risk-on behavior and liquidity rotation toward altcoins.
Bitcoin dominance is calculated as BTC’s market cap divided by the total crypto market cap. It’s displayed prominently across data platforms and is widely tracked by traders. As a concept it’s simple, but it has nuances—for example, stablecoins can distort the picture, and cycles can differ across sectors. Still, as a first-pass macro indicator, it remains useful.
When BTC leads impulsively and dominance rises, altcoins often lag. Once Bitcoin consolidates and dominance fails to ma... [TRUNCADO]

When Anatoly first pitched us Solana (originally called Loom), his deck was called “Blockchain at NASDAQ Speed.” Public blockchains have evolved a lot since then, but at their core, they’re still ledgers for the world’s financial assets.

In traditional finance, trading is fragmented because assets are kept on separate systems. Stocks, options, futures, FX, commodities, payments, and credit each have their own ledgers and ways of clearing, holding, and settling.
Multicoin Capital launched on October 1, 2017. We started the firm with the view that crypto would eventually reshape global markets. Our logo, a phoenix, represents a new financial system rising from the ashes of the old one.

When we began, permissionless finance was hardly a known concept. Eight years later, it’s becoming a reality.
When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in cryp... [TRUNCADO]

HIP-3 is scaling Hyperliquid beyond crypto, with TradFi instruments now 31% of venue volume and daily notional above $5B. Silver is the most important of these flows, and last Friday’s violent move gives a stress test of HIP-3 market health. Using high-frequency trade/quote/order-book data and benchmarking against CME/COMEX Micro Silver futures, we find that for smaller, retail-weighted clips HIP-3 Silver delivered tighter pre-crash spreads and better execution. Finally, we present a novel 24/7 use case: positioning and pricing into the Sunday reopening auction.
MagicBlock is building a real-time execution layer for Solana designed to push the network beyond its practical latency limits. While Solana offers high throughput and low fees, its current base-layer latency floor, with ~400ms block times and ~500ms to 1.2s end-to-end execution, remains a binding constraint for applications that require deterministic, sub-100ms responsiveness.

The stock was seen to be trading around $17.23 following a sharp turn. This was after a significant low below $5.73. The recovery contributed to the stock price by over $11.50.
Much of the work undertaken at Stabull throughout 2025 was intentionally quiet.
Rather than pursuing rapid growth, emissions-led liquidity, or headline volume metrics, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: professional routing, economically rational actors, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely make sense.
As 2026 began, a number of those design decisions started to surface clearly on-chain.
Bitcoin is approaching a technically decisive zone as broader market sentiment cools. After facing rejection near $73,072, the asset has printed multiple consecutive red daily candles, pulling the BTC price today toward the mid-$60,000 region.
Cardano ADA trades near key long-term support around $0.27–$0.29 as analysts watch for a potential relief bounce towards $0.34 or deeper downside risk below $0.25.
Another powerful rally and a quick correction took uranium prices to the level near $90. The short-term market data and commentators indicate that there is mixed market momentum and a stable market structure.
The gold price today is hovering near the pivotal $5,000 mark after a softer-than-expected U.S. inflation report reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve easing later this year.
Ethereum (ETH) trades near a critical support zone as bearish pressure persists, with traders watching whether the price holds $1,850 or faces deeper downside.
The current price movement of XAGUSD, SLV, and Silver Mines Limited indicates declining momentum and narrowing trading bands. As the silver market has had a fast increase, followed by a drastic decline.
Solana price is testing the critical $75–$80 support zone as price momentum weakens, while record on-chain activity and rising TVL signal a potential recovery setup if key resistance levels are reclaimed.
Bitcoin is trading in an increasingly tight range beneath the $68,000 level, where declining volatility and clustered order flow suggest the market may be preparing for a larger directional move.
The gold prices kept at the market at the mark above $5,000 because the market players evaluated short-term resistances and support areas around.
Much of Stabull’s work through 2024 and 2025 was intentionally quiet. Rather than optimising for headline TVL, emissions-led liquidity, or short-lived bursts of incentivised activity, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: externally priced assets, economically rational counterparties, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely warrant it.

We take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative: we stand for accurately, timely and unbiased information.
Here at CoinMarketCap, we work very hard to ensure that all the relevant and up-to-date information about cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens can be located in one easily discoverable place. From the very first day, the goal was for the site to be the number one location online for crypto market data, and we work hard to empower our users with our unbiased and accurate information.
Each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token. Normally, the graph starts at the launch of the asset, but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are free to visitors of our website.  The most experienced and professional traders often choose to use the best crypto API on the market. Our API enables millions of calls to track current prices and to also investigate historic prices and is used by some of the largest crypto exchanges and financial institutions in the world.  CoinMarketCap also provides data about the most successful traders for you to monitor. We also provide data about the latest trending cryptos and trending DEX pairs.
We receive updated cryptocurrency prices directly from many exchanges based on their pairs. We then convert the number to USD. A full explanation can be found here.

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.
Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.
On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”
Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.
However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.
Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.
Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to ap... [TRUNCADO]

Altcoin season indicator: Do the signs point to an altcoin wave?
A strong downtrend in the Bitcoin Dominance chart is necessary for a true altcoin season to commence.
Bitcoin [BTC] could break free of its torpor soon. At the beginning of this week, the price was at $67.7k, and the lack of trading volume and speculative interest suggested that BTC was not ready for a strong uptrend.
This has begun to shift over the past 24 hours. Data from Farside Investors showed that the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw a $886 million inflow on Tuesday, the 4th of June.
This level of buying could spark a change and stir speculators and investors into action.
Will the increased attention to Bitcoin see altcoin prices explode? Or will the altcoin season have to wait? Here are the findings from the altcoin season indicator.
The altcoin season index showed a reading of 31, according to data from BlockchainCentre. The index has trended downward from 80 to 31 over the past six months.
However that was during the depths of the bear market, when Bitcoin was trading at $25k and alts were in a long-term downtrend or consolidation phase.
At press time, even though alts might perform well due to the Bitcoin bullish fervor, only a few select alts might outperform Bitcoin.
If the altcoin season indicator can climb above 75, it’d be a sign of wild bullishness across the altcoin ecosystem.
Given that there are far more alts right now compared the previous cycles, the gains during an altseason might still be concentrated within a chunk of the alts rather than market-wide rallies.
The range-bound Bitcoin Dominance and parallels from the past
The Bitcoin Dominance chart represents the market capitalization of BTC as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The metric formed a range between 53.9% and 56.3% since April.
At press time, it was rebounding from the range lows. An increase in the BTC.D means BTC is growing faster than the rest of the market, Ethereum [ETH] included.
In 2021, from January to June, the BTC dominance fell from 72% to 40.4%. In this window, the altcoin market capitalization (excluding ETH) expanded from $122 billion to $934 billion.
Therefore, a strong downtrend in the BTC.D chart is necessary for a true altcoin season to commence.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the supply of new coins. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. As the first digital currency to enable direct transfers of value without intermediaries, Bitcoin has pioneered a new approach to money. Today, it functions as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, influencing global finance and inspiring many other digital currencies.
Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, making it divisible up to eight decimal places. This means that anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I

RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55

100

[

100

+

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

>>> FUENTE: https://www.okx.com/learn/altcoin-season-2025-trends-metrics-narratives
Altcoin season, commonly referred to as "altseason," is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins—cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin—outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. This phenomenon is typically marked by a decline in Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. During altcoin season, traders and investors shift their focus to altcoins, driving heightened trading volumes and significant price increases across the altcoin market.
Altcoin season represents a unique opportunity for traders and investors to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the explosive growth of altcoins. Understanding the dynamics of altseason can help market participants make informed decisions and maximize returns.
Bitcoin dominance is a critical factor in determining the performance of altcoins. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it often suppresses altcoin growth as most capital flows into Bitcoin. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance drops below key thresholds, such as 50%, altcoins tend to thrive. This shift in dominance signals increased retail and institutional interest in altcoins, often marking the onset of altcoin season.
Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained drop below 50% is a strong indicator of altcoin season.
Altcoin Trading Volume: Increased trading activity in altcoins suggests growing market interest.
Social Media Trends: Heightened discussions and trends around altcoins on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram often precede altcoin rallies.
Bitcoin halving events, which occur approximately every four years, are significant catalysts for cryptocurrency market cycles. These events reduce the block reward for miners, effectively decreasing Bitcoin's supply issuance. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have triggered bull runs, with altcoin rallies typically following Bitcoin's price surges. As Bitcoin's price stabilizes post-halving, investors often seek higher returns in altcoins, setting the stage for altcoin season.
Post-Halving Stability: As Bitcoin's price stabilizes, capital flows into altcoins.
Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around Bitcoin often spills over into the altcoin market.
The growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has reshaped market dynamics. While developments like Bitcoin spot ETFs have strengthened Bitcoin dominance, institutional capital inflows into altcoins are becoming increasingly significant. Pro-crypto regulations and emerging narratives could catalyze a unique altcoin season in 2025.
Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations around altcoins could attract institutional investors.
Emerging Narratives: Sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization are gaining traction among institutional players.
Portfolio Diversification: As the cryptocurrency market matures, institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include altcoins.
Macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates and global liquidity, significantly impact the cryptocurrency marke... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin dominance drops below 59%, signaling capital rotation into altcoins for potential breakout.
Altcoin Google searches rise 40–50%, showing growing public interest and market attention.
Whale activity boosts coins like Aster, Hyperliquid, and XPL, indicating rapid altcoin momentum.
October 1, 2025, The crypto market enters a very bullish month of the calendar with an average return of 21%. Bitcoin is holding above $116,000, and Ethereum trades near $4,301, showing strong support.
But all eyes are on altcoins, as analysts spot early signs of a potential breakout that could trigger the start of a new altcoin season.
Despite BTC and ETH stability, analysts point to key signs suggesting altcoins are about to shine. According to the prominent crypto expert, Ito Shimotsuma, BTC dominance has dropped below 59%, indicating that capital is gradually rotating out of Bitcoin into altcoins.
In the meantime, Google searches for altcoins jumped 40–50% in the last week of September, while the Altcoin Season Index hit 67.
Shimotsuma also pointed out that the altcoin market cap has been in its longest accumulation phase ever, even longer than the 2017 and 2021 cycles. Historically, such build-ups lead to strong rallies with the Q4 beginning, a season often bullish for altcoins.
Supporting the bullish analysis, another analyst, Stockmoney Lizards, points to a four-year falling wedge in the TOTAL3/BTC chart, a long-term structure that tends to resolve with explosive upside.
Analyst says that even if BTC moves sideways or climbs moderately, liquidity is likely to rotate into altcoins, triggering a rapid rally once the wedge breaks.
This pattern mirrors what happened with BTC/USD between 2020 and 2022, where a similar wedge structure led to a major bull leg.
Altcoin season in October 2025 is flashing strong signals, bringing both big opportunities and caution. Whale activity is fueling sharp moves, with Aster (+40% weekly), Hyperliquid, and XPL gaining heavy attention from new listings, derivatives trading, and pre-market buzz.
On top of it, if Bitcoin dominance reverses or ETF approvals accelerate, altcoin season could ignite rapidly.
Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.
Altcoin season is when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. It often signals strong market momentum and new opportunities for investors beyond BTC.
October has a history of strong crypto returns. With Bitcoin stable and altcoins in long accumulation, analysts see a breakout as likely.
Tokens like Aster, Hyperliquid, and XPL are showing strong moves, fueled by listings, derivatives trading, and rising whale activity.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Today, we are announcing a transition in the executive leadership team at the Ethereum Foundation.
After extensive contributions to the Foundation’s mission and operations, Tomasz Stańczak has decided to step down from his role as Co-Executive Director. The Foundation’s Board has appointed Bastian Aue to serve as interim Co-Executive Director, effective immediately.

Tomasz joined the management team during a critical period of growth and maturation for the Foundation. His strategic guidance helped expand our ability to reach out to broad groups of people and teams, and for the EF to understand businesses in the ecosystem more deeply. He also brought a sense of urgency and focus, helped organize EF teams to work more efficiently, and expanded enterprise community development. Through his quick execution, he achieved a remarkable
tl;dr

I am stepping down from my co-ED role at the EF at the end of February 2026. Bastian Aue is taking over the co-ED role alongside Hsiao-Wei. The future is bright for builders, for Ethereum, for the EF, and for me.
The EF's Academic Secretariat team is proud to announce the launch of the inaugural PhD Fellowship Program, a pioneering initiative aimed at empowering and expanding the frontiers of Ethereum-related academic research, by supporting Ethereum-related academic work led by PhD students.
During Devconnect Buenos Aires, the Ethereum Foundation and Secureum TrustX brought together Ethereum security practitioners for Trillion Dollar Security Day, a focused event exploring what it would take to securely support a trillion-dollar Ethereum economy.

The event brought together around eighty participants from across the Ethereum Security Ecosystem—spanning Infrastructure, Interoperability, Layer 1 & 2, Onchain, Offchain, Privacy, and Wallets—to assess the current security landscape, surface shared challenges, and identify concrete next steps across the stack.

The discussions and outputs from this event contribute to the Ethereum Foundation’s ongoing One Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative.
Q4 2025 closed out the year with exciting growth across the ecosystem! Dive into the projects and community initiatives we supported this quarter and see what our grantees have been building:
Ethereum’s All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-8 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.



If you enjoy reading core development updates, you may also be keen to learn that Forkcast now publishes call summaries, chats and transcripts for each All Core Dev (ACD) call and some breakout calls, usually available within a couple hours of the call.
Devcon, the Ethereum community’s annual global gathering for builders, will take place from 3-6 November 2026 at the JIO World Center in Mumbai, India.

When Anatoly first pitched us Solana (originally called Loom), his deck was called “Blockchain at NASDAQ Speed.” Public blockchains have evolved a lot since then, but at their core, they’re still ledgers for the world’s financial assets.

In traditional finance, trading is fragmented because assets are kept on separate systems. Stocks, options, futures, FX, commodities, payments, and credit each have their own ledgers and ways of clearing, holding, and settling.
Multicoin Capital launched on October 1, 2017. We started the firm with the view that crypto would eventually reshape global markets. Our logo, a phoenix, represents a new financial system rising from the ashes of the old one.

When we began, permissionless finance was hardly a known concept. Eight years later, it’s becoming a reality.
When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in cryp... [TRUNCADO]

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

The crypto market moves in cycles, and altcoin season—when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin—remains one of the most anticipated phases. As we move through 2025, investors and traders alike are wondering: when will the next altcoin season begin?
Bitcoin experiences strong price appreciation, attracting capital into the market.
Traders rotate profits into altcoins, triggering widespread rallies.
However, timing this cycle depends on multiple factors, including liquidity conditions, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance.
One of the most reliable indicators for altcoin season is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)—the percentage of total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high (above 50%), Bitcoin is leading the market. But when it starts declining sharply, capital often flows into altcoins.
As of early 2025, Bitcoin dominance remains relatively high, which suggests altcoin season has not yet begun. However, traders are watching for a breakdown below key support levels as a potential trigger.
The Role of interest rates and Quantitative Tightening for Altcoin season
Unlike previous bull cycles, 2025 presents a unique challenge: Quantitative Tightening (QT) and high interest rates. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been withdrawing liquidity from the financial system by reducing their balance sheets and keeping interest rates elevated.
This is a stark contrast to the liquidity-driven rally of 2020–2021 when altcoins thrived in an environment of low interest rates and aggressive money printing. If tightening continues, speculative assets like altcoins could struggle to gain momentum.
However, if economic conditions force central banks to pivot towards a more accommodative stance (such as rate cuts or slowing QT), risk assets—including altcoins—could see a surge in demand.
Apart from macroeconomic trends, specific crypto-market triggers could signal the start of altcoin season in 2025:
Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has led the altcoin rally. A breakout in ETH/BTC would signal that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, marking the start of altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s continued improvements in scalability—such as Layer-2 adoption and the upcoming Pectra upgrade—could provide the infrastructure for a broader altcoin surge.

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.
Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.
On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”
Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.
However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.
Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.
Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to ap... [TRUNCADO]

3 Indicators Suggesting an Altcoin Season May Be Emerging This November
The crypto market has faced heavy losses since the October crash, eroding confidence. While many analysts argue that an altcoin season remains distant, emerging signals are beginning to shift sentiment.
In November 2025, a combination of market psychology, technical indicators, and renewed liquidity inflows suggests the early formation of a potential bull cycle in altcoins.
One of the most closely watched metrics in this context is the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric reflects Bitcoin’s share of total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
According to market data, BTC.D dropped in late June and continued moving downwards. It rebounded in September, though it has yet to reclaim its June highs. At press time, it stood at 59.94%
Despite this, analyst Matthew Hyland noted that the BTC.D chart is still bearish.
“The BTC Dominance…has looked bearish for many weeks. The downtrend is favorable to continue therefore, this relief rally has been a dead cat bounce in a downtrend,” Hyland wrote.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe compared the current cycle to late 2019 and early 2020. At the time, Bitcoin Dominance first declined, briefly recovered, and then entered another major downward leg.
Van de Poppe suggests that today’s market may be at a similar turning point. The analyst anticipates a second drop in BTC.D this quarter.
Adding to this, trader Don pointed to a head-and-shoulders structure on the Bitcoin Dominance chart, a bearish reversal signal. If confirmed, this would likely drive dominance even lower and shift capital toward altcoins.
“Rotation season might be closer than most think,” the trader wrote.
From a psychological perspective, an analyst Merlijn emphasized that altcoin seasons begin during market disbelief, when sentiment is at its lowest.
“ALTCOIN SEASON STARTS WHERE EVERYONE GIVES UP. Same base. Same wedge. Same disbelief. Every previous altseason was born here. Bitcoin cools. Liquidity rotates. It’s time for the real fireworks,” he stated.
Additionally, recent weekend rallies across altcoins indicate a renewed interest from retail investors. Such activity is often a bullish short-term sign, with sentiment shifting from apathy to cautious optimism.
Lastly, new sources of liquidity could become crucial catalysts for an upcoming wave of altcoin gains. BeInCrypto reported that the Federal Reserve is set to restart its quantitative easing program on December 1, a policy shift that could inject significant liquidity into financial markets.
Historically, such moves have lowered borrowing costs, boosted investor confidence, and redirected capital toward higher-risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, potentially setting the stage for renewed momentum across the altcoin sector.
Despite several bullish signals, some analysts warn that a broader altcoin rally may still be far off.

HIP-3 is scaling Hyperliquid beyond crypto, with TradFi instruments now 31% of venue volume and daily notional above $5B. Silver is the most important of these flows, and last Friday’s violent move gives a stress test of HIP-3 market health. Using high-frequency trade/quote/order-book data and benchmarking against CME/COMEX Micro Silver futures, we find that for smaller, retail-weighted clips HIP-3 Silver delivered tighter pre-crash spreads and better execution. Finally, we present a novel 24/7 use case: positioning and pricing into the Sunday reopening auction.
MagicBlock is building a real-time execution layer for Solana designed to push the network beyond its practical latency limits.

The stock was seen to be trading around $17.23 following a sharp turn. This was after a significant low below $5.73. The recovery contributed to the stock price by over $11.50.
Much of the work undertaken at Stabull throughout 2025 was intentionally quiet.
Rather than pursuing rapid growth, emissions-led liquidity, or headline volume metrics, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: professional routing, economically rational actors, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely make sense.
As 2026 began, a number of those design decisions started to surface clearly on-chain.
Bitcoin is approaching a technically decisive zone as broader market sentiment cools. After facing rejection near $73,072, the asset has printed multiple consecutive red daily candles, pulling the BTC price today toward the mid-$60,000 region.
Cardano ADA trades near key long-term support around $0.27–$0.29 as analysts watch for a potential relief bounce towards $0.34 or deeper downside risk below $0.25.
Another powerful rally and a quick correction took uranium prices to the level near $90. The short-term market data and commentators indicate that there is mixed market momentum and a stable market structure.
The gold price today is hovering near the pivotal $5,000 mark after a softer-than-expected U.S. inflation report reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve easing later this year.
Ethereum (ETH) trades near a critical support zone as bearish pressure persists, with traders watching whether the price holds $1,850 or faces deeper downside.
The current price movement of XAGUSD, SLV, and Silver Mines Limited indicates declining momentum and narrowing trading bands. As the silver market has had a fast increase, followed by a drastic decline.
Solana price is testing the critical $75–$80 support zone as price momentum weakens, while record on-chain activity and rising TVL signal a potential recovery setup if key resistance levels are reclaimed.
Bitcoin is trading in an increasingly tight range beneath the $68,000 level, where declining volatility and clustered order flow suggest the market may be preparing for a larger directional move.
The gold prices kept at the market at the mark above $5,000 because the market players evaluated short-term resistances and support areas around.
Much of Stabull’s work through 2024 and 2025 was intentionally quiet. Rather than optimising for headline TVL, emissions-led liquidity, or short-lived bursts of incentivised activity, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: externally priced assets, economically rational counterparties, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely warrant it.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the supply of new coins. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. As the first digital currency to enable direct transfers of value without intermediaries, Bitcoin has pioneered a new approach to money. Today, it functions as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, influencing global finance and inspiring many other digital currencies.
Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, making it divisible up to eight decimal places. This means that anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

Will Prediction Market Volumes Continue to Grow? Bull vs Bear Case | Messari Fully Diluted
The Messari team analyzes prediction markets after the Super Bowl drove record volumes across Kalshi and Polymarket. With $6.2 billion in weekly volume split between sports betting and political markets, the question is whether this represents a local top or sustainable growth. Will prediction markets scale to entertainment, culture, and long-tail markets, or is volume topping out? The discussion covers regulatory advantages, UX challenges, and whether Robin Hood and Coinbase building their own platforms will threaten Kalshi and Polymarket's market share.

Bitcoin is down 1.0% to $68,421.92 in 24h, closely tracking a broader market decline of 1.16% primarily driven by persistent risk-off sentiment and technical selling pressure near key resistance levels.
Primary reason: Broader market weakness, with Bitcoin moving in lockstep with the total crypto market cap decline amid extreme fear sentiment.
Secondary reasons: Technical structure shows Bitcoin trading below major moving averages, testing a critical Fibonacci support level.
Near-term market outlook: If Bitcoin holds above the $67,676 support, consolidation is likely; a break below risks a retest of the $60,074 swing low. Watch for a shift in the Fear & Greed Index from "Extreme Fear."
Bitcoin's decline mirrors the total crypto market cap drop of 1.16% over the same period. The CMC Fear & Greed Index is at 12, signaling "Extreme Fear," reflecting a market-wide risk-off mood. No specific 24-hour catalyst was visible; the move appears consistent with ongoing macro uncertainty and defensive positioning.
What it means: Bitcoin is acting as a high-beta asset to the overall crypto market, with sentiment driving short-term flows more than coin-specific news.
Watch for: A sustained move in the total market cap above $2.36 trillion to signal short-term stabilization.
Bitcoin is trading below its key 30-day Simple Moving Average ($79,471) and 7-day SMA ($68,506), indicating bearish near-term momentum. The price is hovering just above the critical Fibonacci 78.6% retracement support at $67,676.40. The 14-day RSI at 36.21 suggests the asset is oversold but not yet reversing.
What it means: The technical structure shows sellers are in control, with the $67,676 level acting as a major line of defense for bulls.
The immediate trigger is whether Bitcoin can defend the $67,676 Fibonacci support. If it holds, a period of consolidation between $67,676 and the 7-day SMA near $68,506 is the base case. The primary risk case is a breakdown below $67,676, which could trigger another leg down toward the $60,074 swing low, especially if spot volume remains subdued.
What it means: The market is at an inflection point, with the next major directional move likely dictated by the reaction at this key technical level.
Market Outlook: Bearish Pressure
Bitcoin's modest decline is a symptom of fragile market-wide sentiment and technical weakness, with no immediate catalyst to reverse the trend.
Key watch: Can Bitcoin defend the $67,676 support on a daily closing basis, or will a break lower invite renewed selling pressure?

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin dominance drops below 59%, signaling capital rotation into altcoins for potential breakout.
Altcoin Google searches rise 40–50%, showing growing public interest and market attention.
Whale activity boosts coins like Aster, Hyperliquid, and XPL, indicating rapid altcoin momentum.
October 1, 2025, The crypto market enters a very bullish month of the calendar with an average return of 21%. Bitcoin is holding above $116,000, and Ethereum trades near $4,301, showing strong support.
But all eyes are on altcoins, as analysts spot early signs of a potential breakout that could trigger the start of a new altcoin season.
Despite BTC and ETH stability, analysts point to key signs suggesting altcoins are about to shine. According to the prominent crypto expert, Ito Shimotsuma, BTC dominance has dropped below 59%, indicating that capital is gradually rotating out of Bitcoin into altcoins.
In the meantime, Google searches for altcoins jumped 40–50% in the last week of September, while the Altcoin Season Index hit 67.
Shimotsuma also pointed out that the altcoin market cap has been in its longest accumulation phase ever, even longer than the 2017 and 2021 cycles. Historically, such build-ups lead to strong rallies with the Q4 beginning, a season often bullish for altcoins.
Supporting the bullish analysis, another analyst, Stockmoney Lizards, points to a four-year falling wedge in the TOTAL3/BTC chart, a long-term structure that tends to resolve with explosive upside.
Analyst says that even if BTC moves sideways or climbs moderately, liquidity is likely to rotate into altcoins, triggering a rapid rally once the wedge breaks.
This pattern mirrors what happened with BTC/USD between 2020 and 2022, where a similar wedge structure led to a major bull leg.
Altcoin season in October 2025 is flashing strong signals, bringing both big opportunities and caution. Whale activity is fueling sharp moves, with Aster (+40% weekly), Hyperliquid, and XPL gaining heavy attention from new listings, derivatives trading, and pre-market buzz.
On top of it, if Bitcoin dominance reverses or ETF approvals accelerate, altcoin season could ignite rapidly.
Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.
Altcoin season is when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. It often signals strong market momentum and new opportunities for investors beyond BTC.
October has a history of strong crypto returns. With Bitcoin stable and altcoins in long accumulation, analysts see a breakout as likely.
Tokens like Aster, Hyperliquid, and XPL are showing strong moves, fueled by listings, derivatives trading, and rising whale activity.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the supply of new coins. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. As the first digital currency to enable direct transfers of value without intermediaries, Bitcoin has pioneered a new approach to money. Today, it functions as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, influencing global finance and inspiring many other digital currencies.
Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, making it divisible up to eight decimal places. This means that anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.

Today, we are announcing a transition in the executive leadership team at the Ethereum Foundation.
After extensive contributions to the Foundation’s mission and operations, Tomasz Stańczak has decided to step down from his role as Co-Executive Director. The Foundation’s Board has appointed Bastian Aue to serve as interim Co-Executive Director, effective immediately.

Tomasz joined the management team during a critical period of growth and maturation for the Foundation. His strategic guidance helped expand our ability to reach out to broad groups of people and teams, and for the EF to understand businesses in the ecosystem more deeply. He also brought a sense of urgency and focus, helped organize EF teams to work more efficiently, and expanded enterprise community development. Through his quick execution, he achieved a remarkable
tl;dr

I am stepping down from my co-ED role at the EF at the end of February 2026. Bastian Aue is taking over the co-ED role alongside Hsiao-Wei. The future is bright for builders, for Ethereum, for the EF, and for me.
The EF's Academic Secretariat team is proud to announce the launch of the inaugural PhD Fellowship Program, a pioneering initiative aimed at empowering and expanding the frontiers of Ethereum-related academic research, by supporting Ethereum-related academic work led by PhD students.
During Devconnect Buenos Aires, the Ethereum Foundation and Secureum TrustX brought together Ethereum security practitioners for Trillion Dollar Security Day, a focused event exploring what it would take to securely support a trillion-dollar Ethereum economy.

The event brought together around eighty participants from across the Ethereum Security Ecosystem—spanning Infrastructure, Interoperability, Layer 1 & 2, Onchain, Offchain, Privacy, and Wallets—to assess the current security landscape, surface shared challenges, and identify concrete next steps across the stack.

The discussions and outputs from this event contribute to the Ethereum Foundation’s ongoing One Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative.

Ethereum’s All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-8 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.

The stock was seen to be trading around $17.23 following a sharp turn. This was after a significant low below $5.73. The recovery contributed to the stock price by over $11.50.
Much of the work undertaken at Stabull throughout 2025 was intentionally quiet.
Rather than pursuing rapid growth, emissions-led liquidity, or headline volume metrics, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: professional routing, economically rational actors, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely make sense.
As 2026 began, a number of those design decisions started to surface clearly on-chain.
Bitcoin is approaching a technically decisive zone as broader market sentiment cools. After facing rejection near $73,072, the asset has printed multiple consecutive red daily candles, pulling the BTC price today toward the mid-$60,000 region.
Cardano ADA trades near key long-term support around $0.27–$0.29 as analysts watch for a potential relief bounce towards $0.34 or deeper downside risk below $0.25.
Another powerful rally and a quick correction took uranium prices to the level near $90. The short-term market data and commentators indicate that there is mixed market momentum and a stable market structure.
The gold price today is hovering near the pivotal $5,000 mark after a softer-than-expected U.S. inflation report reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve easing later this year.
Ethereum (ETH) trades near a critical support zone as bearish pressure persists, with traders watching whether the price holds $1,850 or faces deeper downside.
The current price movement of XAGUSD, SLV, and Silver Mines Limited indicates declining momentum and narrowing trading bands. As the silver market has had a fast increase, followed by a drastic decline.
Solana price is testing the critical $75–$80 support zone as price momentum weakens, while record on-chain activity and rising TVL signal a potential recovery setup if key resistance levels are reclaimed.
Bitcoin is trading in an increasingly tight range beneath the $68,000 level, where declining volatility and clustered order flow suggest the market may be preparing for a larger directional move.
The gold prices kept at the market at the mark above $5,000 because the market players evaluated short-term resistances and support areas around.
Much of Stabull’s work through 2024 and 2025 was intentionally quiet. Rather than optimising for headline TVL, emissions-led liquidity, or short-lived bursts of incentivised activity, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: externally priced assets, economically rational counterparties, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely warrant it.

When Anatoly first pitched us Solana (originally called Loom), his deck was called “Blockchain at NASDAQ Speed.” Public blockchains have evolved a lot since then, but at their core, they’re still ledgers for the world’s financial assets.

In traditional finance, trading is fragmented because assets are kept on separate systems. Stocks, options, futures, FX, commodities, payments, and credit each have their own ledgers and ways of clearing, holding, and settling.
Multicoin Capital launched on October 1, 2017. We started the firm with the view that crypto would eventually reshape global markets. Our logo, a phoenix, represents a new financial system rising from the ashes of the old one.

When we began, permissionless finance was hardly a known concept. Eight years later, it’s becoming a reality.
When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in cryp... [TRUNCADO]

3 Indicators Suggesting an Altcoin Season May Be Emerging This November
The crypto market has faced heavy losses since the October crash, eroding confidence. While many analysts argue that an altcoin season remains distant, emerging signals are beginning to shift sentiment.
In November 2025, a combination of market psychology, technical indicators, and renewed liquidity inflows suggests the early formation of a potential bull cycle in altcoins.
One of the most closely watched metrics in this context is the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric reflects Bitcoin’s share of total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
According to market data, BTC.D dropped in late June and continued moving downwards. It rebounded in September, though it has yet to reclaim its June highs. At press time, it stood at 59.94%
Despite this, analyst Matthew Hyland noted that the BTC.D chart is still bearish.
“The BTC Dominance…has looked bearish for many weeks. The downtrend is favorable to continue therefore, this relief rally has been a dead cat bounce in a downtrend,” Hyland wrote.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe compared the current cycle to late 2019 and early 2020. At the time, Bitcoin Dominance first declined, briefly recovered, and then entered another major downward leg.
Van de Poppe suggests that today’s market may be at a similar turning point. The analyst anticipates a second drop in BTC.D this quarter.
Adding to this, trader Don pointed to a head-and-shoulders structure on the Bitcoin Dominance chart, a bearish reversal signal. If confirmed, this would likely drive dominance even lower and shift capital toward altcoins.
“Rotation season might be closer than most think,” the trader wrote.
From a psychological perspective, an analyst Merlijn emphasized that altcoin seasons begin during market disbelief, when sentiment is at its lowest.
“ALTCOIN SEASON STARTS WHERE EVERYONE GIVES UP. Same base. Same wedge. Same disbelief. Every previous altseason was born here. Bitcoin cools. Liquidity rotates. It’s time for the real fireworks,” he stated.
Additionally, recent weekend rallies across altcoins indicate a renewed interest from retail investors. Such activity is often a bullish short-term sign, with sentiment shifting from apathy to cautious optimism.
Lastly, new sources of liquidity could become crucial catalysts for an upcoming wave of altcoin gains. BeInCrypto reported that the Federal Reserve is set to restart its quantitative easing program on December 1, a policy shift that could inject significant liquidity into financial markets.
Historically, such moves have lowered borrowing costs, boosted investor confidence, and redirected capital toward higher-risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, potentially setting the stage for renewed momentum across the altcoin sector.
Despite several bullish signals, some analysts warn that a broader altcoin rally may still be far off.

The crypto market moves in cycles, and altcoin season—when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin—remains one of the most anticipated phases. As we move through 2025, investors and traders alike are wondering: when will the next altcoin season begin?
Bitcoin experiences strong price appreciation, attracting capital into the market.
Traders rotate profits into altcoins, triggering widespread rallies.
However, timing this cycle depends on multiple factors, including liquidity conditions, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance.
One of the most reliable indicators for altcoin season is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)—the percentage of total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high (above 50%), Bitcoin is leading the market. But when it starts declining sharply, capital often flows into altcoins.
As of early 2025, Bitcoin dominance remains relatively high, which suggests altcoin season has not yet begun. However, traders are watching for a breakdown below key support levels as a potential trigger.
The Role of interest rates and Quantitative Tightening for Altcoin season
Unlike previous bull cycles, 2025 presents a unique challenge: Quantitative Tightening (QT) and high interest rates. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been withdrawing liquidity from the financial system by reducing their balance sheets and keeping interest rates elevated.
This is a stark contrast to the liquidity-driven rally of 2020–2021 when altcoins thrived in an environment of low interest rates and aggressive money printing. If tightening continues, speculative assets like altcoins could struggle to gain momentum.
However, if economic conditions force central banks to pivot towards a more accommodative stance (such as rate cuts or slowing QT), risk assets—including altcoins—could see a surge in demand.
Apart from macroeconomic trends, specific crypto-market triggers could signal the start of altcoin season in 2025:
Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has led the altcoin rally. A breakout in ETH/BTC would signal that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, marking the start of altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s continued improvements in scalability—such as Layer-2 adoption and the upcoming Pectra upgrade—could provide the infrastructure for a broader altcoin surge.

Altcoin season, commonly referred to as "altseason," is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins—cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin—outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. This phenomenon is typically marked by a decline in Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. During altcoin season, traders and investors shift their focus to altcoins, driving heightened trading volumes and significant price increases across the altcoin market.
Altcoin season represents a unique opportunity for traders and investors to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the explosive growth of altcoins. Understanding the dynamics of altseason can help market participants make informed decisions and maximize returns.
Bitcoin dominance is a critical factor in determining the performance of altcoins. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it often suppresses altcoin growth as most capital flows into Bitcoin. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance drops below key thresholds, such as 50%, altcoins tend to thrive. This shift in dominance signals increased retail and institutional interest in altcoins, often marking the onset of altcoin season.
Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained drop below 50% is a strong indicator of altcoin season.
Altcoin Trading Volume: Increased trading activity in altcoins suggests growing market interest.
Social Media Trends: Heightened discussions and trends around altcoins on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram often precede altcoin rallies.
Bitcoin halving events, which occur approximately every four years, are significant catalysts for cryptocurrency market cycles. These events reduce the block reward for miners, effectively decreasing Bitcoin's supply issuance. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have triggered bull runs, with altcoin rallies typically following Bitcoin's price surges. As Bitcoin's price stabilizes post-halving, investors often seek higher returns in altcoins, setting the stage for altcoin season.
Post-Halving Stability: As Bitcoin's price stabilizes, capital flows into altcoins.
Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around Bitcoin often spills over into the altcoin market.
The growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has reshaped market dynamics. While developments like Bitcoin spot ETFs have strengthened Bitcoin dominance, institutional capital inflows into altcoins are becoming increasingly significant. Pro-crypto regulations and emerging narratives could catalyze a unique altcoin season in 2025.
Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations around altcoins could attract institutional investors.
Emerging Narratives: Sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization are gaining traction among institutional players.
Portfolio Diversification: As the cryptocurrency market matures, institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include altcoins.
Macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates and global liquidity, significantly impact the cryptocurrency marke... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin Price Analysis: What Does the Latest Rejection at $70K Mean for BTC’s Structure?
Bitcoin’s recent bounce has pushed the market back toward the $70K–$72K area, but the broader structure remains fragile. The key question now is whether this rebound can evolve into a deeper corrective move toward overhead resistance, or if it is merely a temporary reaction within a dominant downtrend. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On […]
Bitcoin charts usually present the progress of the price using Japanese candlesticks. Each candle represents a specific time-frame (depends on the chart) and is showing the open, close, and price range during that time-frame.
On top of that, the chart usually contains a variety of technical analysis indicators. The most popular are support and resistance levels, trend-lines, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Fibonacci retracement levels.
Just like any other traded asset, the Bitcoin price is affected by supply and demand, as simple as that. However, the occurrence of certain global fundamental events could have a relation to the value of Bitcoin: During the year of 2016, for example, India’s banknote demonetization had a positive effect on Bitcoin. In India, the price of the cryptocurrency was trading 20% higher than the rest of the world.
If we go to recent years, the 2019 bull-run could be related to Facebook announcing on the Libra project. The bull-run started losing momentum as news regarding Libra’s regulation’s hardness started popping on the news.
Besides the major global events, there are some Bitcoin heavy-bag holders, which are also known as Bitcoin Whales. They are holding thousands of BTC’s, and that is enough to create large enough daily price maneuvers.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1
+

Average gain
Average loss



]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(


1
%

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

Home » Crypto & Blockchain » Crypto Alert – Alt Season 2025 Is Here
Crypto alt season 2025 officially started on November 9th, 2024.
Three indicators confirm crypto alt season 2025 started on November 9th: crypto total market cap excl. BTC and ETH breaks out, Dogecoin clears its 50% Fibonacci level, the USD remains below 107 points.
In this article, we review 3 out of the 4 indicators that are screaming ALT SEASON 2025 is here.
Interestingly, the 4th indicator is testing a breakout, so it might be a matter of hours or days until all alt season 2025 confirmations are in!
First alt season indicator – total crypto market cap excl. leading indicators BTC/ETH.
This indicator matters simply because it excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). That’s because the two largest cryptocurrencies are great leading indicators, but tend to move slower when alts accelerate their move (typically at the start of alt season).
As seen below, we accurately predicted the start of alt season 2024 late January 2024, see chart below.
This crypto market breakout has legs. The first two targets are shown on the chart. That’s quite some upside potential before alt season 2025 gets back to its 2021 highs (where the breakout process to ATH will start).
The second indicator is Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate alt season barometer. It is now above its most important Fibonacci level, since Nov 9th, 2024, confirming alt season 2025.
We have been repeating the importance of the 50% Fibonacci level throughout all our writings since many years.
Dogecoin is clearing, convincingly, its 50% Fibonacci level, around Nov 9th, 2024.
The message is loud and clear – Dogecoin, the ultimate bullish momentum barometer among all altcoins, is starting a new bullish wave. This is the most convincing alt season 2025 signal.
The third indicator is an external one – the US Dollar, inversely correlated to crypto markets, is unable to clear its 50% Fibonacci level (so far, at least) – this raises confidence in the alt season indicators outlined above.
The US Dollar is inversely correlated to Bitcoin and altcoins.
The USD chart makes it clear – it may have bounced in October, but the bounce happened from oversold levels.
Once the USD clears 107 points, it will turn bullish. Given this current chart setup, it seems a rather low probability for the USD to turn bullish. Until the USD turns bullish, crypto can move much higher.
The 4th (and last) indicator confirming a new alt season is Shiba, the 2nd largest meme, which ideally also confirms a breakout.
Arguably, its chart suggests that it’s a matter of time, either hours or days, until SHIB clears THE most important Fibonacci level which is $.00002345.
If and when SHIB moves above this level, it will be the final indicator confirming the new bullish trend in alts.
This new alt season has legs, and will not peak before June 2025 is our thesis.
Premium crypto members were alerted ahead of the breakout – most of our token tips alts have risen between 30 to 200... [TRUNCADO]

Today, we are announcing a transition in the executive leadership team at the Ethereum Foundation.
After extensive contributions to the Foundation’s mission and operations, Tomasz Stańczak has decided to step down from his role as Co-Executive Director. The Foundation’s Board has appointed Bastian Aue to serve as interim Co-Executive Director, effective immediately.

Tomasz joined the management team during a critical period of growth and maturation for the Foundation. His strategic guidance helped expand our ability to reach out to broad groups of people and teams, and for the EF to understand businesses in the ecosystem more deeply. He also brought a sense of urgency and focus, helped organize EF teams to work more efficiently, and expanded enterprise community development. Through his quick execution, he achieved a remarkable
tl;dr

I am stepping down from my co-ED role at the EF at the end of February 2026. Bastian Aue is taking over the co-ED role alongside Hsiao-Wei. The future is bright for builders, for Ethereum, for the EF, and for me.
The EF's Academic Secretariat team is proud to announce the launch of the inaugural PhD Fellowship Program, a pioneering initiative aimed at empowering and expanding the frontiers of Ethereum-related academic research, by supporting Ethereum-related academic work led by PhD students.
During Devconnect Buenos Aires, the Ethereum Foundation and Secureum TrustX brought together Ethereum security practitioners for Trillion Dollar Security Day, a focused event exploring what it would take to securely support a trillion-dollar Ethereum economy.

The event brought together around eighty participants from across the Ethereum Security Ecosystem—spanning Infrastructure, Interoperability, Layer 1 & 2, Onchain, Offchain, Privacy, and Wallets—to assess the current security landscape, surface shared challenges, and identify concrete next steps across the stack.

The discussions and outputs from this event contribute to the Ethereum Foundation’s ongoing One Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative.
Q4 2025 closed out the year with exciting growth across the ecosystem! Dive into the projects and community initiatives we supported this quarter and see what our grantees have been building:
Ethereum’s All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-8 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:

I

[

100

]



RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55
=
100
−

[

100

1
+


(

14

)


(


0.8
%

14

)




]



55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ]


55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

When Anatoly first pitched us Solana (originally called Loom), his deck was called “Blockchain at NASDAQ Speed.” Public blockchains have evolved a lot since then, but at their core, they’re still ledgers for the world’s financial assets.

In traditional finance, trading is fragmented because assets are kept on separate systems. Stocks, options, futures, FX, commodities, payments, and credit each have their own ledgers and ways of clearing, holding, and settling.
Multicoin Capital launched on October 1, 2017. We started the firm with the view that crypto would eventually reshape global markets. Our logo, a phoenix, represents a new financial system rising from the ashes of the old one.

When we began, permissionless finance was hardly a known concept. Eight years later, it’s becoming a reality.
When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in cryp... [TRUNCADO]

The CMC Altcoin Season Index page provides real-time insights into whether the cryptocurrency market is currently in Altcoin Season, based on the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days, with detailed charts and metrics for tracking market trends and altcoin dominance.
During Altcoin Season, several distinct market characteristics emerge:
Increased Altcoin Dominance: Altcoins collectively gain prominence in the cryptocurrency market. In the recent Altcoin Season in May 2021, the combined market capitalization of the top 100 altcoins reached around 130% of Bitcoin's.
﻿﻿Rapid Price Appreciation: Altcoins experience significant price increases across the board, often outpacing the growth of Bitcoin. For example, large-cap altcoin prices achieved 174% returns versus BTC's 2% during the Altcoin Season from February to May 2021. Many narratives pop up and are not limited to just one or two trends.
FOMO: Overall market sentiment during Altcoin Season is typically bullish, driven by optimism about the potential for altcoins to deliver substantial returns. FOMO mentality is evidenced by high 24-hour trade volume across all large-cap coins, leading to increased buying pressure and price momentum.
What altcoins are used in this index? Is Ethereum an altcoin?

>>> FUENTE: https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/
The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.
Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.
On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”
Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.
However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.
Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.
Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to ap... [TRUNCADO]

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence is rooted in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, "Liber Abaci," popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields such as science, nature, architecture, and finance, due to its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms feature Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels, including 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks, as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, to identify oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and confirm ... [TRUNCADO]

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

Will Prediction Market Volumes Continue to Grow? Bull vs Bear Case | Messari Fully Diluted
The Messari team analyzes prediction markets after the Super Bowl drove record volumes across Kalshi and Polymarket. With $6.2 billion in weekly volume split between sports betting and political markets, the question is whether this represents a local top or sustainable growth. Will prediction markets scale to entertainment, culture, and long-tail markets, or is volume topping out? The discussion covers regulatory advantages, UX challenges, and whether Robin Hood and Coinbase building their own platforms will threaten Kalshi and Polymarket's market share.

The stock was seen to be trading around $17.23 following a sharp turn. This was after a significant low below $5.73. The recovery contributed to the stock price by over $11.50.
Much of the work undertaken at Stabull throughout 2025 was intentionally quiet.
Rather than pursuing rapid growth, emissions-led liquidity, or headline volume metrics, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: professional routing, economically rational actors, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely make sense.
As 2026 began, a number of those design decisions started to surface clearly on-chain.
Bitcoin is approaching a technically decisive zone as broader market sentiment cools. After facing rejection near $73,072, the asset has printed multiple consecutive red daily candles, pulling the BTC price today toward the mid-$60,000 region.
Cardano ADA trades near key long-term support around $0.27–$0.29 as analysts watch for a potential relief bounce towards $0.34 or deeper downside risk below $0.25.
Another powerful rally and a quick correction took uranium prices to the level near $90. The short-term market data and commentators indicate that there is mixed market momentum and a stable market structure.
The gold price today is hovering near the pivotal $5,000 mark after a softer-than-expected U.S. inflation report reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve easing later this year.
Ethereum (ETH) trades near a critical support zone as bearish pressure persists, with traders watching whether the price holds $1,850 or faces deeper downside.
The current price movement of XAGUSD, SLV, and Silver Mines Limited indicates declining momentum and narrowing trading bands. As the silver market has had a fast increase, followed by a drastic decline.
Solana price is testing the critical $75–$80 support zone as price momentum weakens, while record on-chain activity and rising TVL signal a potential recovery setup if key resistance levels are reclaimed.
Bitcoin is trading in an increasingly tight range beneath the $68,000 level, where declining volatility and clustered order flow suggest the market may be preparing for a larger directional move.
The gold prices kept at the market at the mark above $5,000 because the market players evaluated short-term resistances and support areas around.
Much of Stabull’s work through 2024 and 2025 was intentionally quiet. Rather than optimising for headline TVL, emissions-led liquidity, or short-lived bursts of incentivised activity, the focus was on building execution infrastructure capable of handling real market behaviour: externally priced assets, economically rational counterparties, and capital that moves only when conditions genuinely warrant it.
